# PowerballNumbers
Get the most reasent powerball numbers

This is a simple python scraping program that scrapes the powerball.com website for the most recent powerball numbers.
It then displays the numbers in a simple GUI with wxPython. To be sure that the most recent powerball numbers are out 
the program must be run the day after release. This would be a simple fix but My purpose was not to learn more about datetime,
but to learn more about webscraping.

Requirements:
Python 2.x, bs4, wx

Comming Soon:
Probably nothing as this project is compleated but, if I decide to spend more time on this,
imporvments will be made:
A nicer looking GUI,
A SQLite3 database to track recent numbers,
An algorithm that suggests which numbers to pick for the next drawing,
An algorithm to track percentage of correct future guesses,
A precomplied executable for users.
